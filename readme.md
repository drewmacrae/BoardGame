# Board Game

I heard an idea that was too good not to act on the other day, so here is a couple of board games that use RGB LEDs in lieue of colorful marbles. The goal is to enable correspondence play of some gimes (and the original idea was centered on a game called "Chinese Checkers" in the US where it was invented by modifying a German game that could be played on a square board.

## Project Structure

I have a license of Solidworks 2014 on my machine so I used that for the 3D CAD, but I don't think it's good.
I wanted to play with a newer ECAD solution than I have a license to so now I'm learning to use KICAD(pronounced however you want maybe)... LMK if I do weird things in it. I probably just don't know better.
Software is not yet included or written.
The board and BOM are all for Through Hole parts. They're more expensive, but this enables easier debugging and better assembly processes early on. It also means it could be shared as a hobby kit, rather than a finished piece.
